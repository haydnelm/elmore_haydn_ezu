1. Merging our overwritten Django admin templates would be one customization we could use to help with the testing process of the
controller assignment. For example, we could have one "complete" template that is just a merger of every template details page.
Basically, it contains all tables and details that the original pages would have, you'd just scroll to see each result. This measure
would be solely for the purpose of testing, and thus, you could have a pretty unique and non-streamlined URL for it. We could also
delete it after testing, or rather, temporarily "disable" it until further use might be needed. This might help with seeing each page
as quickly as possible without the need to retype URLs.
