One change we could make to the django admin app for this week would be adding custom admin actions.
This concept is featured within the third recommended link: https://testdriven.io/blog/customize-django-admin/
Basically, we could add a new admin request that allows us to perform multiple actions at once.
For instance, this week we're testing deletes and the structural integrity of our database. We could
add an admin action that allows us to attempt to delete multiple different records (students, sections, instructor, etc...)
The action could feed a report similar to each individual action, it'd just be compounded into one response.
Essentially, we'd be able to mass test each of our data columns rather than testing one at a time.
