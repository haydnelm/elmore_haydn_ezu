One thing that we might be able to add to the Django admin app to aid in this assignment could be a complete link tree/outline.
Sort of like how you would write an outline for a paper, you could have an outline of links and their sub-links.
Indentation would be included to make it more readable, but you could have a complete list of every link and every
sub-link for every page. Sort of like a master view.
