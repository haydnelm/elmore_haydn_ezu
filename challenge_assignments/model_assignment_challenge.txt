One customization that I came across during my research to improve the Django Admin app is hyperlinking to other pages.
For example, each of courses could have a hyperlink to a separate student column that displays every student registered in the course.
Following along that logic, we could have a hyperlink to the list of courses that each individual instructor teaches.
This change could increase the speed and workflow of viewing our testing data.

Another customization that I came across was adding filters. Now, the EZU database that's been created so far doesn't have a ton of data.
So, filters might not be extremely useful. However, as more data is added, filters become more and more impactful.
We could, for instance, filter specific courses by their semester. We could also filter something like periods for courses.
