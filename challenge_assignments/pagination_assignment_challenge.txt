Considering a lot of this assignment has to do with visual changes, I'm really not sure of any ideas. The pagination aspect
of this assignment can be explored simply by clicking through the "next" and "previous" buttons. I put some thought into how
to explore that in a better way, but I really have no clue. It seems like active exploration is the best way. The CSS aspect
of this assignment can really only be explored by visiting different html pages. A lot of this assignment was instructor driven,
there were a lot of copy and pasted changes. I'm sorry that I couldn't answer this question, but I am not really sure what changes
I could make to the Django admin app that would help or assist with this week's work. Maybe I'm looking at it in the wrong way.
Do you have any suggestions?
