1. One change that we could make is properly hyper-linking each URL (for course, instructor, registration, etc...)
so that we could access each URL from each other URL location. This would create fluidity and increase the speed
in which we would be able to test/view the website. Currently, we'd need to type each web handle at the top in
the URL search bar. I believe all we would need to do to implement this is to add a reference link to each webpage
in each html file.

2. Another change we could implement would be CSS code in general. I know this doesn't necessarily make anything
more efficient, but it might make things easier on the eyes which could help with the overall process. It wouldn't
be too terribly difficult to add CSS either, you could just work on your preferences for one file and then duplicate
the file for each other page. Then you'd just change the necessary words in the code (like course, instructor, etc...)
to make sure that it works properly.
